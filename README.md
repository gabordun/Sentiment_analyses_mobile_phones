# Sentiment_analyses_mobile_phones project

Investigate web sentiment as a factor from 0 to 5 toward iPhone and Samsung Galaxy. The aim is to predict sentiment toward these devices 
upon given circumstances.

The data was generated from the common crawl web project via the Amazon Web Services console. I use Python scripts while the task 
is specified in a json file. I run AWS EC2 instances and use the Elastic Map Reducer
service to crawl 100 addresses from the common crawl project. The project run from a command line interface.

Finding: there is only a minor sentiment difference, but iPhone is a bit more beloved.

Softwares: Command Line Interface, Sublime Text 3 as a text editor, Cyberduck to download data from the corresponding S3 bucket of the AWS Console.
